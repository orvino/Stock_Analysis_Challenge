# Stock Analysis Challenge with VBA

## Overview and Purpose of the Project

### Overview

We worked on a stock VBA project to help, Steve, determine the most desirable stocks for his parents to choose.  The information was provided for the years 2017 and 2018, and included buttons to run the analysis, select the year, highlight positvit or negative outcomes, and a clear button to start over.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to take what we had previously done to for Steve and improve upon it.  The improvement process is called refactoring.  The goal of refractoring is to add/delete lines of code to increase efficiency and readibility of the previous version.  The efficiency will be the easiest to measure as it is time based.

## Results

### Analysis
Here are the results for 2017 and 2018 for the twelve stocks selected:

These images show only one stock, RUN, increased its return in 2018 from 2017.  All the other stocks took a massive hit into negative returns, other than ENPH.  ENPH still remained as a positive return in 2018, however, less than in the previous year.  We can also the effect of returns ahd slowdown in daily volume amongst most of the stock downturns, with a few exceptions, TER and VSLR.

### Code
We only used twelve stocks for this example and hard coded them into our VBA.

If we to make any changes to these stock choices or selections, we would have to return and change the values or add them and increase our string count.  This was a limitation of the data set and what we were trying to accomplish.
