# Stock Analysis Challenge with VBA

## Overview and Purpose of the Project

### Overview

We worked on a stock VBA project to help, Steve, determine the most desirable stocks for his parents to choose.  The information was provided for the years 2017 and 2018, and included buttons to run the analysis, select the year, highlight positvit or negative outcomes, and a clear button to start over.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to take what we had previously done to for Steve and improve upon it.  The improvement process is called refactoring.  The goal of refractoring is to add/delete lines of code to increase efficiency and readibility of the previous version.  The efficiency will be the easiest to measure as it is time based.

## Results

### Analysis
Here are the results for 2017 and 2018 for the twelve stocks selected:
